                Elements (specified as selectors) that will be ignored when comparing screenshots.
                Ignoring is implemented by painting the listed elements black. In the case of a
                single element, the parameter can be specified as a string.

                By default, Testplane throws an error if an element is outside the viewport
                boundaries. This parameter disables boundary checking, allowing screenshots of
                elements that do not fit within the viewport. Only the parts of the element that fit
                within the viewport will be visible in the screenshot. However, if _compositeImage_
                is set to _true_, parts of the element that are below the viewport will also be
                visible in the screenshot. Similarly, if _captureElementFromTop_ is set to _true_,
                parts of the element that are above the viewport will also be included in the
                screenshot.

                If the element does not fit within the viewport, enabling this option will take
                multiple screenshots of different parts of the element sequentially, and then stitch
                them together into one image to display the entire element.

                Delay in milliseconds before taking a screenshot. This can be useful when there are
                elements on the page that use animation, or a scrollbar that does not disappear
                immediately and ends up in the resulting screenshot.

                Selector to scroll. This can be useful when you need to take a screenshot of a modal
                window that does not fit on the screen. Otherwise, without specifying the selector,
                the scroll will be applied to the _window_ object, and the background will scroll,
                leaving the popup window in place.
