# Global Testplane Helper

## testplane.skip.in

This directive allows you to skip the test in a specific browser. For example, if you don't want to run the test in `IE8`:

```javascript
describe("feature", function () {
    testplane.skip.in("ie8", "it cannot work in this browser");
    it("nowaday functionality", function () {
        // ...
    });
});
```

When using the `testplane.skip.in` directive, you will see a message in the report indicating that the run was skipped in the respective browser.

To skip the test runs without notifications in the report, you can pass a special flag `silent` to the helper as the third argument:

```javascript
testplane.skip.in("ie8", "skipReason", { silent: true });
```

## testplane.skip.notIn

This directive allows you to run the test only in a specific browser, for example, in `Chrome`:

```javascript
describe("feature", function () {
    testplane.skip.notIn("chrome", "it should work only in Chrome");
    it("specific functionality", function () {
        // ...
    });
});
```

Similarly, to avoid notifications in the report, you can pass a special flag `silent` to the helper as the third argument:

```javascript
testplane.skip.notIn("chrome", "skipReason", { silent: true });
```

## testplane.only.in / testplane.only.notIn

These directives allow you to run the test only in a specific browser, whose logic is the opposite of the `testplane.skip.in` and `testplane.skip.notIn` directives. Additionally, these helpers do not, by default, produce any notifications in the report:

```javascript
testplane.only.in("chrome"); // run the test only in Chrome
```

```javascript
testplane.only.notIn("ie8"); // run the test in all browsers except IE8
```

## testplane.also.in

If you are introducing a new browser and need to run it only in a few tests while having thousands of them, using the `.skip.in` helper may be inconvenient. You can use the [passive][passive-option] browser option and the helper `.also.in`:

```javascript
testplane.also.in("ie8"); // run the test in the passive browser IE8
```
