# plugins

## Overview {#overview}

With the `plugins` section, you can connect external plugins to Testplane, which will expand the available functionality.

For example, plugins like [html-reporter][html-reporter] or [@testplane/safari-commands](https://github.com/gemini-testing/testplane-safari-commands).

A plugin is a module that exports a single function, which takes the following arguments:

-   Testplane instance
-   Plugin options from the Testplane config

All plugins will be loaded before Testplane starts running tests.

<Admonition type="tip">
    When choosing a name for a plugin, add the prefix _testplane-_ to it. This will make it easier
    to find such a plugin.
</Admonition>

If the plugin name starts with the prefix `testplane-`, this prefix can be omitted when adding the plugin to the `plugins` section. If there are modules with both names on the file system: _testplane-some-module_ and _some-module_, preference will be given to the module with the `testplane-` prefix.

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <td>`config`</td>
            <td>The config used in the test runner. Can be modified.</td>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>`events`</td>
            <td>List of events that can be subscribed to.</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

You can learn more about events on the [corresponding page](../../testplane-events).

## Parallel Execution of Plugins

The runner has a `registerWorkers` method, which can be used to register custom methods for running in Testplane workers.

The `registerWorkers` method takes 2 arguments:

-   `workerFilepath` — path to the file with functions, a string with an absolute path.
-   `exportedMethods` — names of exported methods, an array of strings.

The method returns an object with the methods listed in `exportedMethods`, which return promises with results.

Note that the file in `workerFilepath` must export an object with the corresponding methods.

Example:

<RegisterWorkersExample />

## Useful Plugins

The Testplane ecosystem includes dozens of plugins. Here are some of them:

-   [html-reporter](https://github.com/gemini-testing/html-reporter)
-   [@testplane/safari-commands](https://github.com/gemini-testing/testplane-safari-commands)
-   [@testplane/headless-chrome](https://github.com/gemini-testing/testplane-headless-chrome)
-   ...and many others that can be found in [gemini-testing](https://github.com/search?q=topic%3Atestplane-plugin+org%3Agemini-testing&type=Repositories).
