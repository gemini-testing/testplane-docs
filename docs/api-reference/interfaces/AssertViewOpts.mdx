## Properties

| Property | Type | Default value | Description | Inherited from | Defined in |
| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| `allowViewportOverflow?` | `boolean` | `false` | Disables check that element is outside of the viewport left, top, right or bottom bounds. **Remarks** By default Testplane throws an error if element is outside the viewport bounds. This option disables check that element is outside of the viewport left, top, right or bottom bounds. And in this case if browser option [https://github.com/gemini-testing/testplane#compositeimage compositeImage](https://github.com/gemini-testing/testplane#compositeimage) set to `false`, then only visible part of the element will be captured. But if [https://github.com/gemini-testing/testplane#compositeimage compositeImage](https://github.com/gemini-testing/testplane#compositeimage) set to `true` (default), then in the resulting screenshot will appear the whole element with not visible parts outside of the bottom bounds of viewport. | `Partial.allowViewportOverflow` | testplane-docs/.testplane/src/config/types.ts:45 |
| `antialiasingTolerance?` | `number` | `4` | Minimum difference in brightness (zero by default) between the darkest/lightest pixel (which is adjacent to the antialiasing pixel) and theirs adjacent pixels. Overrides config https://github.com/gemini-testing/testplane#browsers browsers.https://github.com/gemini-testing/testplane#antialiasingTolerance antialiasingTolerance value. **Remarks** Read more about this option in [https://github.com/gemini-testing/looks-same#comparing-images-with-ignoring-antialiasing looks-same](https://github.com/gemini-testing/looks-same#comparing-images-with-ignoring-antialiasing) | - | testplane-docs/.testplane/src/browser/commands/types.ts:26 |
| `captureElementFromTop?` | `boolean` | `true` | Ability to set capture element from the top area or from current position. **Remarks** In the first case viewport will be scrolled to the top of the element. | `Partial.captureElementFromTop` | testplane-docs/.testplane/src/config/types.ts:33 |
| `compositeImage?` | `boolean` | `true` | Allows testing of regions which bottom bounds are outside of a viewport height. Overrides config https://github.com/gemini-testing/testplane#browsers browsers.https://github.com/gemini-testing/testplane#compositeImage compositeImage value. **Remarks** In the resulting screenshot the area which fits the viewport bounds will be joined with the area which is outside of the viewport height. | - | testplane-docs/.testplane/src/browser/commands/types.ts:36 |
| `disableAnimation?` | `boolean` | `true` | Ability to disable animations and transitions while making a screenshot **Remarks** Usefull when you capture screenshot of a page, having animations and transitions. Iframe animations are only disabled when using webdriver protocol. | - | testplane-docs/.testplane/src/browser/commands/types.ts:67 |
| `ignoreDiffPixelCount?` | `number` \| \`$\{number\}%\` | `0` | Ability to ignore a small amount of different pixels to classify screenshots as being "identical" **Examples** `5` `'1.5%'` **Remarks** Useful when you encounter a few pixels difference that cannot be eliminated using the tolerance and antialiasingTolerance settings. **Note** This should be considered a last resort and only used in small number of cases where necessary. | - | testplane-docs/.testplane/src/browser/commands/types.ts:82 |
| `ignoreElements?` | `string` \| `string`[] | `[]` | DOM-node selectors which will be ignored (painted with a black rectangle) when comparing images. | `Partial.ignoreElements` | testplane-docs/.testplane/src/config/types.ts:24 |
| `screenshotDelay?` | `number` | `0` | Allows to specify a delay (in milliseconds) before making any screenshot. Overrides config https://github.com/gemini-testing/testplane#browsers browsers.https://github.com/gemini-testing/testplane#screenshotDelay screenshotDelay value. **Remarks** This is useful when the page has elements which are animated or if you do not want to screen a scrollbar. | - | testplane-docs/.testplane/src/browser/commands/types.ts:46 |
| `selectorToScroll?` | `string` | `undefined` | Ability to set DOM-node selector which should be scroll when the captured element does not completely fit on the screen. **Remarks** Useful when you capture the modal (popup). In this case a duplicate of the modal appears on the screenshot. That happens because we scroll the page using `window` selector, which scroll only the background of the modal, and the modal itself remains in place. Default value is `undefined` (it means scroll relative to `window`). Works only when `compositeImage` is `true` (default). | - | testplane-docs/.testplane/src/browser/commands/types.ts:57 |
| `tolerance?` | `number` | `2.3` | Maximum allowed difference between colors. Overrides config https://github.com/gemini-testing/testplane#browsers browsers.https://github.com/gemini-testing/testplane#tolerance tolerance value. **Remarks** Indicates maximum allowed CIEDE2000 difference between colors. Used only in non-strict mode. Increasing global default is not recommended, prefer changing tolerance for particular suites or states instead. By default it's 2.3 which should be enough for the most cases. | - | testplane-docs/.testplane/src/browser/commands/types.ts:16 |
