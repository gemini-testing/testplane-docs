# Debugging Tests

## Problem {#problem}

In the course of developing tests, any developer will sooner or later encounter errors that are hard to detect through normal code review. At such moments, it's necessary to use software tools to understand where the error occurred, or why the test is behaving differently than expected.

Let's explore the options available to a Testplane test developer.

## Solution 1: --inspect or --inspect-brk option {#solution_1}

To see how a test is executed step by step, Testplane has a debug mode. This mode relies on the [V8 inspector integration with Node.js](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v16.x/docs/api/debugger.html#advanced-usage).

About V8 Inspector Integration with Node.js

</summary>

The integration with the _V8_ inspector allows connecting _Chrome DevTools_ to a _Node.js_ instance for debugging and profiling. This uses the _Chrome DevTools_ protocol.

The _V8_ inspector can be enabled by passing the `--inspect` option when starting a _Node.js_ application. You can also specify a custom port with this option; for example, `--inspect=9222` will accept `DevTools` connections on port `9222`.

To stop the code execution at the first line of the application, use the `--inspect-brk` option instead of `--inspect`.

```bash
$ node --inspect index.js
Debugger listening on ws://127.0.0.1:9229/dc9010dd-f8b8-4ac5-a510-c1a114ec7d29
For help, see: https://nodejs.org/en/docs/inspector
```

_In the example above, the `UUID dc9010dd-f8b8-4ac5-a510-c1a114ec7d29` at the end of the URL is generated "on the fly," and varies in different debugging sessions._

If the Chrome browser is older than `66.0.3345.0`, use `inspector.html` instead of `js_app.html` in the above URL.

_Chrome DevTools_ does not yet support debugging for [worker threads](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v16.x/docs/api/worker_threads.html). To debug them, you can use [ndb](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/ndb/).

</details>

To run a test in this mode, use the `--inspect` option. If you want the debugger to stop at the first line of code, use the `--inspect-brk` option.

Example:

```bash
testplane path/to/mytest.js --inspect
```

<Admonition type="info">
    In debug mode, only one worker process is started, and all tests are run in it. Use this mode
    with the parameter _sessionsPerBrowser=1_ to debug tests one at a time.
