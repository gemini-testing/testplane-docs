# How to Skip a Test in a Specific Browser

## Problem {#problem}

Sometimes you need to skip running a test in a specific browser, rather than in all browsers. That is, you don't want to disable or delete the entire test, but only want to limit the number of browsers in which it will run.

For example, this could be due to the limited functionality of the respective browser: the absence of necessary features that are used on the web page and checked by the test.

Another reason could be the unstable behavior of the test in a particular browser due to certain implementation nuances in the browser.

In testplane, you can do this using special helpers (directives) `skip` and `only`.

## Solution 1: .skip.in Directive {#solution_1}

For example, if you don't want to run the test in `IE8`:

```javascript
describe("feature", function () {
    testplane.skip.in("ie8", "it cannot work in this browser");
    it("nowaday functionality", function () {
        // ...
    });
});
```

When using the `testplane.skip.in` directive, you will see a message in the report indicating that the run was skipped in the respective browser.

To skip the test runs without notifications in the report, you can pass a special flag `silent` to the helper as the third argument:

```javascript
testplane.skip.in("ie8", "skipReason", { silent: true });
```

## Solution 2: .skip.notIn Directive {#solution_2}

You might also want to run the test only in a specific browser, for example, in `Chrome`:

```javascript
describe("feature", function () {
    testplane.skip.notIn("chrome", "it should work only in Chrome");
    it("specific functionality", function () {
        // ...
    });
});
```

Similarly, to avoid notifications in the report, you can pass a special flag `silent` to the helper as the third argument:

```javascript
testplane.skip.notIn("chrome", "skipReason", { silent: true });
```

## Solution 3: .only.in and .only.notIn Directives {#solution_3}

You can also use the helpers `only.in` and `only.notIn`, whose logic is the opposite of the helpers `skip.in` and `.skip.notIn`. Additionally, these helpers do not, by default, produce any notifications in the report:

```javascript
testplane.only.in("chrome"); // run the test only in Chrome
```

```javascript
testplane.only.notIn("ie8"); // run the test in all browsers except IE8
```

## Solution 4: .also.in Directive and Passive Browser Option {#solution_4}

If you are introducing a new browser and need to run it only in a few tests while having thousands of them, using the `.skip.in` helper may be inconvenient. To solve this problem, you can use the [passive][passive-option] browser option and the helper `.also.in`:

```javascript
testplane.also.in("ie8"); // run the test in the passive browser IE8
```
