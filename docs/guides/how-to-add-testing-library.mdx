# Installing Testing Library

## Introduction {#preface}

[Testing-library][testing-library] is a collection of tools for testing web application user interfaces, focused on creating reliable and maintainable tests by emphasizing user behavior. The main advantage of `testing-library` is its focus on interaction with interface elements. And in testplane, you can use the element search methods provided by the `testing-library` itself.

## Installation

To be able to use [queries][queries] from `testing-library` in Testplane tests, you only need to follow a few steps.

1. Install the npm package `@testplane/testing-library` (our adapter package for the original testing-library)

```bash
npm i -D @testplane/testing-library
```

2. Include it in the Testplane config in the `prepareBrowser` section:

```typescript
// testplane.config.ts
import { setupBrowser } from "@testplane/testing-library";

export default {
    prepareBrowser(browser) {
        setupBrowser(browser);
    },

    // other settings for testplane...
};
```

If you have problems with types, add types explicitly to `tsconfig.json`

```json
{
    "compilerOptions": {
        "types": ["testplane", "@testplane/testing-library"]
    }
}
```

## Usage

You can search by selectors from `testing-library` as described in the [official docs](https://testing-library.com/docs/queries/about/). For example, here's how to search for an element by its text:

```javascript
it("example", async ({ browser }) => {
    await browser.url("https://github.com/");

    const newRepoButton = await browser.getByText("New");

    await newRepoButton.click();
});
```

You can also use testing-library queries on elements:

```javascript
it("example", async ({ browser }) => {
    await browser.url("https://github.com/");

    const sidebar = await browser.$(".dashboard-sidebar");
    const newRepoButton = await sidebar.getByText("New");

    await newRepoButton.click();
});
```
