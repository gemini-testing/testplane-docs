# How to Manage CPU Performance

## Overview {#overview}

This recipe only works when using _Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP)_.

The CPU speed on mobile devices is significantly slower than on computers. Therefore, to emulate CPU speed in _puppeteer_, there is a method called [emulateCPUThrottling][emulate-cpu-throttling].

## Example: Slowing Down CPU Speed by 8x {#example}

Let's use this method to slow down CPU speed by 8 times:

```javascript
it("should open yandex.ru with emulation 8x slower CPU", async function ({browser}) {
    // Get puppeteer instance
    const puppeteer = await browser.getPuppeteer();

    // Get the first open page (considering it to be currently active)
    const [page] = await puppeteer.pages();

    // Slow down the CPU speed by 8 times
    await page.emulateCPUThrottling(8);

    await browser.url("https://yandex.ru");
});
```

## A Small Story About a Workaround {#workaround_in_the_past}

Initially, _webdriverio_ did not support the `page.emulateCPUThrottling` method because _webdriverio_ used _puppeteer-core@9.1.0,_ not _puppeteer-core@10.1.0_, which supports this method.

However, this limitation could be bypassed using puppeteer's [CDPSession.send()][cdp-session-send] method by sending the browser the [Emulation.setCPUThrottlingRate][emulation-set-cpu-throttling-rate] command via CDP:

```javascript
it("should open yandex.ru with emulation 8x slower CPU", async function ({browser}) {
    // Get puppeteer instance
    const puppeteer = await browser.getPuppeteer();

    // Get the first open page (considering it to be currently active)
    const [page] = await puppeteer.pages();

    // Create a CDP session
    const client = await page.target().createCDPSession();

    // Slow down the CPU speed by 8 times
    await client.send("Emulation.setCPUThrottlingRate", { rate: 8 });

    await browser.url("https://yandex.ru");
});
```

Later, we submitted a requisite [pull request](https://github.com/webdriverio/webdriverio/pull/7135) to _webdriverio_ to update the version of _puppeteer-core_. Now, the [emulateCPUThrottling][emulate-cpu-throttling] method is available in Testplane right out of the box.
