# How to Manage Network Bandwidth

## Overview {#overview}

<Admonition type="warning">
This recipe only works when using _Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP)_.

Read details in the section “[How to use CDP in Testplane][how-to-use-cdp]”.

</Admonition>

A large number of users access services from mobile devices where internet speed can be quite slow or may even drop out intermittently. In _webdriverio_, we can limit network bandwidth using the [throttle][throttle] method, thereby testing the website's behavior under various network conditions.

Besides custom settings, the [throttle][throttle] method supports the following ready-made presets:

-   offline | online
-   GPRS
-   Regular2G | Good2G
-   Regular3G | Good3G
-   Regular4G
-   DSL
-   WiFi

## Example 1: Emulating a 2G Connection {#example_1}

Let's emulate a 2G connection and open yandex.ru in Chrome with phone emulation:

```javascript
it("should open yandex.ru with emulation of 2G-connection", async function ({ browser }) {
    // Emulate a 2G connection
    await browser.throttle("Good2G");

    await browser.url("https://yandex.ru");
});
```

## Example 2: Emulating a Network with Given Characteristics {#example_2}

We can also emulate a connection with specific characteristics:

```javascript
it("should open yandex.ru with emulation of custom connection", async function ({ browser }) {
    // Emulate a network connection with specified characteristics
    await browser.throttle({
        offline: false, // emulate offline state
        downloadThroughput: (10 * 1024) / 8, // max download bandwidth (byte/sec)
        uploadThroughput: (10 * 1024) / 8, // max upload bandwidth (byte/sec)
        latency: 10, // min latency from sending the request to receiving the response headers
    });

    await browser.url("https://yandex.ru");
});
```
