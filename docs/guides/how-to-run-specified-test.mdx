# How to Run Specific Tests

## Problem {#problem}

Sometimes you may need to run specific tests rather than the entire set of tests in your project.

For example, you developed a feature and covered it with functional tests. You might want to first check the correctness of the new tests.

Or you are fixing a flaky test, found bugs, fixed them, and want to verify that the test now passes correctly.

## Solution 1: Running a Specific File {#solution_1}

If you want to run a whole group of tests located in a specific file, specify the path to this file as an input parameter for testplane:

```bash
testplane src/features/Reviews/Reviews.test/MyReview/MyReview.a11y@touch-phone.testplane.js
```

## Solution 2: --grep Option {#solution_2}

If you want to run a specific test, use the `--grep` option by providing the full name of the test as its value:

```bash
testplane --grep "Accessibility Leaving a review"
```

## Solution 3: .only Directive {#solution_3}

You can also use the `.only` directive for a suite of tests (`describe`) or a specific test (`it`), similar to what is implemented in `mocha` (see the [exclusive tests](https://mochajs.org/#exclusive-tests) section):

For example:

```javascript
describe.only("Accessibility", function () {
    // Test suite...
});
```

or

```javascript
it.only("Leaving a review", async function () {
    // Test code...
});
```
