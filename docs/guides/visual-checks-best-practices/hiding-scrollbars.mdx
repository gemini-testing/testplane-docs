# Hiding Scrollbars

Scrollbars can be a source of flakiness in visual tests — they can randomly appear, disappear and change their position. We strongly recommend hiding them if you perform visual checks.

Example of a diff due to scrollbar:

## Solution 1: Using the `--hide-scrollbars` flag (recommended) {#solution_1}

Chrome, starting from around version 50 (and likely other Chromium-based browsers) supports the `--hide-scrollbars` flag. You can specify it in the browser settings like this:

```diff
module.exports = {
    browsers: {
        chrome: {
            desiredCapabilities: {
                browserName: "chrome",
                browserVersion: "125.0",
                "goog:chromeOptions": {
                    args: ["--hide-scrollbars"],
                },
            },
        },
    },
};
```

## Solution 2: screenshotDelay {#solution_2}

If the browser you are using doesn't support the `--hide-scrollbars` flag, you can use the `screenshotDelay` option to wait until the scrollbar disappears or becomes stable.

In Testplane settings, there is a mandatory option `browsers` that specifies the set of browsers available in the project and their properties. Select the browser where you are experiencing diffs due to scrollbars and add the `screenshotDelay` option for it:

```javascript
module.exports = {
    browsers: {
        iphone: {
            screenshotDelay: 600, // Delay before taking a screenshot in ms

            // other browser settings...
        },

        // other browsers...
    },

    // other Testplane settings...
};
```

The `screenshotDelay` option sets a pause in milliseconds that Testplane should wait before taking a screenshot (before executing the `assertView` command).

### How can it help? {#how_can_it_help}

Often screenshots generate diffs because the test needs to scroll the page to the required element just before taking the screenshot. After the scroll is performed, the scrollbar might still be visible on the screen for some time and thus, might appear in the screenshot if taken immediately. The `screenshotDelay` gives the scrollbar time to disappear.

However, this method does not always work as it depends on the implementation and behavior of the browsers.

## Solution 3: Disabling Scrollbars using CDP {#solution_3}

This solution is useful for very old Chrome versions or browsers that do not support the `--hide-scrollbars` flag, but do support the `Emulation.setScrollbarsHidden` CDP method.

If scrollbars appear in screenshots in the Chrome browser, they can be disabled using the [DevTools protocol][CDP].

To do this, add the [hermione-hide-scrollbars][hermione-hide-scrollbars] plugin to your project and specify in its settings the list of browsers for which you want to disable scrollbars in the tests.

<Admonition type="warning">
    Update the Chrome browser to version 72.1 or higher for this functionality to work in your
    tests. Earlier versions of Chrome do not support the _Emulation.setScrollbarsHidden_ command,
    which is used to disable the scrollbars.
</Admonition>

The `hermione-hide-scrollbars` plugin is based on the `Emulation.setScrollbarsHidden` CDP method, so alternatively you can do it yourself:

```javascript
it("should hide scrollbar", async function ({ browser }) {
    // Get puppeteer instance
    const puppeteer = await browser.getPuppeteer();

    // Get the first open page (considering it to be currently active)
    const [page] = await puppeteer.pages();

    // Create a CDP session
    const client = await page.target().createCDPSession();

    // Hide the scrollbar
    await client.send("Emulation.setScrollbarsHidden", { hidden: true });

    await browser.url("https://yandex.ru");
});
```
