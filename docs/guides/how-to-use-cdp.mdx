# How to Use Chrome DevTools Protocol in Testplane

## Introduction {#preface}

<Admonition type="warning">
    Install Hermione (Testplane) version 4 or higher in your project to use _Chrome DevTools
    Protocol (CDP)_ in Testplane tests.
</Admonition>

The `WebDriver` protocol has been used in Testplane for a long time, but the possibility of using [CDP][CDP] appeared only after migrating to _[WebdriverIO@7](https://webdriver.io/versions)_ in Hermione version 4.

CDP support in _WebdriverIO@7_ is implemented using [puppeteer][puppeteer], which is a wrapper with a convenient API over CDP.

For a comparison of the _WebDriver_ and _CDP_ protocols, see the "WebDriver vs CDP" section in the Reference Manual.

## Local Usage {#local_usage}

To work with the browser via CDP locally, add the `automationProtocol: 'devtools'` option to the browser settings in the Testplane config:

```javascript
// .testplane.conf.js

module.exports = {
    browsers: {
        chrome: {
            automationProtocol: "devtools",
            desiredCapabilities: {
                // ...
            },
        },

        // other browser settings...
    },

    // other Testplane settings...
};
```

After this, all subsequent runs will be performed in your locally installed Chrome.

But if you need to run a browser with CDP support just once, it's more convenient to override this option using an environment variable:

```bash
testplane_browsers_chrome_automation_protocol=devtools npx testplane ...
```

Or set it as a CLI option:

```bash
npx testplane ... --browsers-chrome-automation-protocol=devtools
```

## Remote Usage {#remote_usage}

When using CDP on a remote machine (e.g., in a grid), Testplane will first start the browser using the WebDriver protocol and then, upon user request (i.e., when calling a CDP command), switch to CDP connection. Thus, in a single test scenario with a remote browser, we will interact using both protocols.

It looks something like this:

To connect to a remote browser via CDP, you need to:

-   use `automationProtocol: webdriver` (default value);
-   add the vendor-specific field `selenoid:options` in the browser’s `desiredCapabilities`: this option is necessary for _webdriverio_ to understand that it needs to connect to a remote machine instead of a local browser.

```javascript
// .testplane.conf.js

module.exports = {
    browsers: {
        chrome: {
            desiredCapabilities: {
                "selenoid:options": {},
                // ...
            },

            // other browser settings...
        },

        // other browser settings...
    },

    // other Testplane settings...
};
```

<Admonition type="warning" title="Limitations">
    Full CDP usage is only supported from **Chrome@77** and higher. This is due to the internal
    implementation in _webdriverio._
</Admonition>
