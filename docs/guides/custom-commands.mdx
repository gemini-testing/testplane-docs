# Custom Commands

Testplane allows you to enhance your test suites by adding custom commands. These commands can streamline repetitive tasks, encapsulate complex actions, and improve code readability.

## Adding Custom Commands to the Browser Object

<Admonition type="tip">
    A good place to add all of your custom commands is
    [`prepareBrowser`](../config/prepare-browser.mdx) hook.
</Admonition>

To add a custom command to the `browser` object, use the `addCommand` method. Here's how you can define a command that retrieves both the URL and title of the current page:

```typescript
browser.addCommand("getUrlAndTitle", async function () {
    // this in the context of custom commands points to browser object
    return {
        url: await this.getUrl(),
        title: await this.getTitle(),
    };
});
```

You can then use this custom command in your tests:

```typescript
it("should fetch URL and title", async function () {
    const result = await browser.getUrlAndTitle();
    console.log(result); // { url: 'https://example.com', title: 'Example Domain' }
});
```

## Adding Custom Commands to Elements

Custom commands can also be added to element instances. For instance, to create a command that gets element position:

<AddElementCommandExample />

Note the last, third parameter is set to `true` â€” it means that this command should be added to element instances.

## Overwriting Existing Commands

There might be scenarios where you need to modify the behavior of existing commands. Testplane allows you to overwrite these commands using the `overwriteCommand` method. For example, to add logging to the `click` command:

```typescript
browser.overwriteCommand("click", async function (this: WebdriverIO.Element, origClick, options) {
    console.log("Element clicked:", this.selector);
    await origClick(options);
});
```

In this example, before executing the original `click` function, a message is logged to the console.

## Using Custom Commands with TypeScript

To ensure TypeScript recognizes your custom commands, you need to augment the WebdriverIO types. To do that, follow these simple steps:

1.  Create a `custom-commands.d.ts` file in your project.

2.  Make sure TypeScript compiler "sees" this file during build: you might need to include it in your `tsconfig.json`.

3.  Write your type definitions as follows. Note that there are two file contexts in TypeScript: module and ambient. If you have at least one import/export in your file, the file is in "module" mode, otherwise it's in ambient. Choose declaration style accordingly.

    <TabItem value="module" label="Module mode" default>

            ```typescript
            import 'webdriverio'; // Can be any import, not necessarily webdriverio

            declare global {
                declare namespace WebdriverIO {
                    interface Browser {
                        customCommand: (arg: any) => Promise<void>
                    }

                    interface Element {
                        elementCustomCommand: (arg: any) => Promise<void>
                    }
                }
            }
            ```

        </TabItem>
        <TabItem value="ambient" label="Ambient mode">

            ```typescript
            declare namespace WebdriverIO {
                interface Browser {
                    customCommand: (arg: any) => Promise<void>
                }

                interface Element {
                    elementCustomCommand: (arg: any) => Promise<void>
                }
            }
            ```

        </TabItem>

</Tabs>

This declaration extends the `Browser` and `Element` interfaces to include your custom commands, allowing TypeScript to recognize them without errors.
