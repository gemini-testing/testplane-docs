<br />

Testplane UI or, as we also call it, `html-reporter` — is an open-source project that can be used to view test results or interact with tools like [Testplane](https://testplane.io), [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) or [Jest](https://jestjs.io/).

## Features

#### Run and debug your tests

View test steps, replay them and when something goes wrong, find the root cause with ease.

#### Superb visual testing capabilities

Accept or undo changes in visual checks with one click. Multiple viewing modes and dedicated visual checks tab will help you analyze the difference.

#### Unified UI for CI and local usage

Something went wrong in CI? Pull the report and continue troubleshooting locally.

#### Powerful analytics

Spot flaky tests, slow tests or other issues using "sort by" and "group by" options.

#### And so much more

Benefits over regular reporters include:

-   **More than a reporter**: it's not static, you can run your tests, update reference images, analyze test runs and more.
-   **Save developer time**: no need to relaunch reports or switch terminals during development — the whole workflow is possible from the UI.
-   **No vendor lock-in**: all data is yours, the UI is open-source and everything is running locally on your machine. There's no cloud.
-   **Optimized to work at scale**: doesn't matter if you have 100 or 100,000+ tests in one report — the UI will work just as smoothly. Built-in support for artifacts uploading on the fly to S3 or other storage.
-   **Multiple data sources**: html-reporter can pull and merge data from any amount of data sources at runtime, or you can use dedicated merge-reports command.

## Getting started

<Admonition type="info">
Currently `html-reporter` needs Node v18 or higher and works with Testplane, Playwright and Jest.

Note that html-reporter is tool-agnostic at its core, so adding support for a new tool is a matter of implementing new data adapters. If you have a specific tool in mind, [raise an issue](https://github.com/gemini-testing/html-reporter/issues) — let's discuss what can be done.

</Admonition>

1. Install `html-reporter` with your favorite package manager:

    ```shell
    npm i -D html-reporter
    ```

2. Turn it on in your tool's config:

    <Tabs>
<TabItem value="Testplane" label="Testplane">
    ```javascript title="testplane.config.ts"
    export = {
        // ...
        plugins: {
            'html-reporter/testplane': {
                enabled: true,
                path: 'html-report',
            },
        },
    };
    ```

    </TabItem>

    <TabItem value="Playwright" label="Playwright">
    ```javascript title="playwright.config.ts"
    // playwright.config.ts
    export default defineConfig({
        // ...
        reporter: [
            ['html-reporter/playwright', {
                enabled: true,
                defaultView: 'failed',
                path: 'html-report',
            }],
        ],
    });
    ```

    </TabItem>

    <TabItem value="Jest" label="Jest">
    ```javascript title="jest.config.ts"
    const config = {
        // ...
        reporters: [
            ['html-reporter/jest', {
                path: 'html-report',
            }]
        ],
    };
    ```
</TabItem>

    </Tabs>

3. Run your tests and see the report:

    ```shell
    npm test

    npx serve html-report
    ```

4. Try UI mode to run your tests from the UI:

    ```shell
    npx html-reporter gui
    ```

    Note: UI mode is available only for Testplane and Playwright. To use with Playwright, add `--tool playwright`.
