# Testplane vs Playwright

Both **Testplane** and **Playwright** are end-to-end testing solutions, but they have different approaches and capabilities. In this article, we'll conduct a detailed comparison of these tools to help you make the right choice.

## Brief Tool Overview

**Testplane** is a web application test automation tool developed by the Yandex team. It is actively used in both large and small company projects and supports a wide range of browsers and devices.

**Playwright** is a tool from Microsoft that has quickly gained popularity due to its ease of use and modern approach to automation.

## Key Differences

### Browser and Mobile Device Support

<Admonition type="tip">Testplane supports both desktop browsers and mobile devices</Admonition>

One of Testplane's key advantages is its versatility in working with desktop browsers and mobile devices. Unlike Playwright, which focuses on modern desktop browsers of the latest versions, Testplane provides full support for both old and new browser versions.
This is important for companies that work with users using outdated browsers. A complete comparison of the two approaches can be seen in the table below:

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <td>**Criteria**</td>
            <td>**Testplane**</td>
            <td>**Playwright**</td>
            <td>**Why It Matters**</td>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>Browser Source</td>
            <td>Original binaries from browser vendors</td>
            <td>Custom builds</td>
            <td>Maximum proximity to real devices</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Browser Versions</td>
            <td>Any — from legacy to latest</td>
            <td>Browser version tied to Playwright version</td>
            <td>Simultaneous coverage of users on both new and outdated browsers</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Mobile Devices</td>
            <td>Android and iOS: browsers + native applications</td>
            <td>No</td>
            <td>Unified stack for desktop and mobile devices</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Remote Grid</td>
            <td>Selenium Grid/Selenoid/BrowserStack/SauceLabs (any remote grid)</td>

        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

### Visual Testing

<Admonition type="tip">Testplane offers advanced visual testing capabilities</Admonition>

In the area of visual (screenshot) testing, Testplane demonstrates clear superiority over Playwright.
Under the hood, the tool uses its own [looks-same][looks-same] library for screenshot comparison, which is [faster][looks-same-benchmarks] and more accurate than current competitors:

-   Waiting for elements to load before taking screenshots to eliminate test instability;
-   Disabling animations on the page;
-   Flexible configuration of screenshot testing sensitivity — [tolerance][tolerance], [anti-aliasing tolerance][anti-aliasing-tolerance], ignoring a fixed number of pixels;
-   Uses 3 levels of comparison for speed optimization;
-   Various [types of visualization of differences between screenshots][report-visual-testing] for convenient debugging, including highlighting small diffs;
-   Ignoring elements in screenshots when necessary.

Testplane provides a convenient [interface][reporter] for bulk screenshot acceptance, which speeds up the process of updating reference images.
Also, if [Storybook][storybook] is configured in the user's project, Testplane provides [automatic generation of screenshot tests][storybook-autotests], which allows you to quickly cover all project components with visual checks **without writing code**.

Playwright offers only basic screenshot testing support with limited capabilities and a less convenient interface for working with screenshots. This makes it less suitable for projects where visual testing is important.

### Test Report Interface

<Admonition type="tip">
    Testplane has a powerful UI for working with tests in various scenarios
</Admonition>

Testplane has a graphical interface that not only shows the results of your test execution but also provides extensive capabilities for working with them.

This report is perfect for both local work and use in CI. It offers a unified interface for performing various tasks:

-   Running tests directly from the UI;
-   Debugging with [Time Travel][time-travel] (step-by-step test replay);
-   Test performance analysis;
-   Updating reference images in screenshot testing;
-   Merging multiple reports into one;
-   Reusing results from CI.

It's especially important that Testplane's report can efficiently work with thousands of tests without losing performance. The plugin system allows customizing reports for specific team needs.

You can explore all report capabilities in the [UI][reporter] section of the https://testplane.io website.

### AI Integration

<Admonition type="tip">
    Testplane MCP helps AI agents write stable new tests and fix existing ones
</Admonition>

[Testplane MCP][testplane-mcp] is a tool that allows AI agents to immerse themselves in the context of what's happening in the browser, perform actions, and create or fix tests based on the real state of the page.
With Testplane MCP, users can not only create working and stable tests but also quickly fix existing ones. Testplane MCP allows connecting to the browser during your test execution to debug or modify it. This significantly reduces the time spent fixing unstable tests.
Additionally, Testplane MCP provides the ability to run the browser in mobile device emulation mode. For example, you can say "Open example.com page using Testplane MCP on iPhone 15" or explicitly specify which User Agent should be used when creating a browser session.

### Extensibility and Integrations

<Admonition type="tip">Testplane provides more customization capabilities</Admonition>

Testplane's architecture is built with customization and integration needs in mind. The rich [event model](/docs/v8/reference/testplane-events) provides numerous extension points, allowing developers to inject their own logic at any stage of test execution. This is especially important for projects that require integration with internal monitoring, reporting, and quality management systems.
Testplane also provides a JS API that allows creating custom runners adapted to specific project needs.

Playwright, despite its popularity, offers fewer extension points and requires independent development of most integrations. This increases the time for implementation and maintenance of the tool in a corporate environment.

### Scaling and Performance

<Admonition type="tip">Testplane is proven on large projects with millions of tests</Admonition>

Testplane's architecture was initially designed to work with large volumes of tests, ensuring stable operation even with significant growth in test coverage. This is especially important for long-term projects where the number of tests constantly increases.
Support for remote browser grids (e.g., BrowserStack, SauceLabs, etc.) allows efficient distribution of test execution across multiple machines, ensuring fast execution even of very large test suites.
Testplane also allows scaling runs through sharding, running tests on different machines. As a result, the user will be provided with a unified report with the results of passed tests.

Playwright also has scaling capabilities in the form of out-of-the-box sharding. Scaling through remote grid is provided only as a paid service [Microsoft Playwright Testing][mpt].

### Updates and Stability

Testplane ensures high stability through a thoughtful approach to dependency management. Tool updates are completely decoupled from browser updates, allowing teams to control the migration process and avoid unexpected failures in CI/CD pipelines. Using stable browser versions minimizes screenshot retaking issues, which is especially important for projects with many visual tests.
This approach ensures predictable test behavior and reduces testing infrastructure maintenance costs. Teams can plan browser updates independently of the testing tool updates, providing more flexibility in managing technical debt.

Playwright links tool updates with browser updates, which can lead to unexpected changes in test behavior. This creates additional burden on development teams who have to more frequently review and update screenshots, especially in projects with active interface development.

## Selection Recommendations
