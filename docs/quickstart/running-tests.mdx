# Running Tests

Use the `npx testplane` command to run all tests in your project.

## Running a Specific File {#running_a_specific_file}

If you want to run a whole group of tests located in a specific file, specify the path to this file as an input parameter for testplane:

```bash
npx testplane src/features/Reviews/Reviews.test/MyReview/MyReview.a11y@touch-phone.testplane.js
```

## The `--grep` Option {#the_grep_option}

If you want to run a specific test, use the `--grep` option by providing the full name of the test as its value:

```bash
npx testplane --grep "Accessibility Leaving a review"
```

## The `.only` Directive {#the_only_directive}

You can also use the `.only` directive for a suite of tests (`describe`) or a specific test (`it`), similar to what is implemented in `mocha` (see the [exclusive tests](https://mochajs.org/#exclusive-tests) section):

For example:

```javascript
describe.only("Accessibility", function () {
    // Test suite...
});
```

or

```javascript
it.only("Leaving a review", async function () {
    // Test code...
});
```
