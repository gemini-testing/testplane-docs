# Installation and Setup

## System requirements

To start working with Testplane, install `Node.js` version 18.0 or higher.

## Installation {#install}

To run the Testplane installer using `npm`, execute the following command:

```bash
npm init testplane@latest YOUR_PROJECT_PATH
```

To configure the project instead of using defaults during initialization, specify the `-v` option.

After running the installation command, the following set of files and folders will appear in the project directory:

```bash
node_modules
testplane-tests
    example.testplane.ts
    ts.config.json
package-lock.json
package.json
testplane.config.ts
```

## Setup {#setup}

The `testplane.config.ts` file contains a basic set of settings for running tests:

```typescript
export default {
    gridUrl: "local",
    baseUrl: "http://localhost",
    pageLoadTimeout: 0,
    httpTimeout: 60000,
    testTimeout: 90000,
    resetCursor: false,

    // The `sets` parameter contains information about the directory where the tests are located
    // and a list of browsers in which they will be run:
    sets: {
        desktop: {
            files: ["testplane-tests/**/*.testplane.(t|j)s"],
            browsers: ["chrome", "firefox"],
        },
    },

    // The `browsers` field describes the configuration of the browsers used:
    browsers: {
        chrome: {
            headless: true,
            desiredCapabilities: {
                browserName: "chrome",
            },
        },
        firefox: {
            headless: true,
            desiredCapabilities: {
                browserName: "firefox",
            },
        },
    },

    plugins: {
        "html-reporter/testplane": {
            enabled: true,
            path: "testplane-report",
            defaultView: "all",
            diffMode: "3-up-scaled",
        },
    },
};
```

To download the browsers described in the config separately from running Testplane itself, execute the command:

```bash
npx testplane install-deps
```

Without running this command beforehand, missing browsers will be automatically downloaded the first time Testplane is launched.
