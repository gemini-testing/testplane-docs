# switchToRepl

## Overview {#overview}

Use the `switchToRepl` command to stop the test execution and open an interactive `REPL` interface in the terminal where you can execute code line by line and observe the results in real-time. This mode allows for convenient debugging of problematic tests both in a locally installed browser and in a remote grid (for example, using [VNC][vnc]).

For more convenient use of the `REPL` mode, it is recommended to use the [VS Code extension][extension].

## Usage {#usage}

```typescript
await browser.runStep(stepName, stepCb);
```

## Command Parameters {#parameters}

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <td>**Name**</td>
            <td>**Type**</td>
            <td>**Description**</td>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>`stepName`</td>
            <td>`string`</td>
            <td>Step name.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>`context`</td>
            <td>`Record<string, unknown>`</td>
            <td>A context with data that will be available in the interactive console.</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

## Usage Examples {#examples}

```typescript
it("test", async ({ browser }) => {
    console.log("before open repl");

    await browser.switchToRepl();

    console.log("after open repl");
});
```

When executing this test, the text before open repl will first be printed to the console. Then, the test execution will stop, and an interactive `REPL` interface will open in the terminal, waiting for command input.
For example, you can execute the following command and immediately get the result of its execution:

```bash
> await browser.getUrl();
about:blank
```

After you finish working in the `REPL` (for instance, by pressing `Cmd+D`), the test execution will continue, and the text after open repl will be printed in the terminal console, after which the browser will close.

You can also pass context to the REPL so that a variable is available in the interface. For example:

```
it("test", async ({browser}) => {
    const counter = 1;

    await browser.switchToRepl({ counter });
});
```

Since we passed the `counter` variable to the context, it will be available in the terminal:

```bash
npx hermione --repl --grep "test" -b "chrome"
> console.log("counter:", counter);
counter: 1
```
