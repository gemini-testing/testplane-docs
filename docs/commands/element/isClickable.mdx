# isClickable

## Overview {#overview}

Use the `isClickable` command to determine whether a given DOM element is clickable.

The command returns `true` if the selected DOM element:

-   exists
-   is visible
-   is within the viewport (if not, try scrolling to the element)
-   has its center unobstructed by another element
-   is not disabled

Otherwise, the command returns `false`.

<Admonition type="warning">
The _isClickable_ command works only in a web browser and in the _webview_ context of mobile applications.

The command does not work in the native context of mobile applications.

Additionally, unlike other element commands, Testplane will not wait for the element to exist before executing this command.

</Admonition>

## Usage {#usage}

```javascript
await browser.$(selector).isClickable();
```

## Usage Examples {#examples}

```javascript
it("should detect if an element is clickable", async ({ browser }) => {
    const el = await browser.$("#el");
    let clickable = await el.isClickable();
    console.log(clickable); // outputs: true or false

    // wait until the element is clickable
    await browser.waitUntil(() => el.isClickable());
});
```
