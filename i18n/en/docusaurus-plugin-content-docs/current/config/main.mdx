# Testplane Config

By default, when launched, Testplane looks for a `.testplane.conf.ts` or `testplane.config.ts` file in the current working directory.

You can specify your configuration file using the `--config` CLI option.

## Setup {#setup}

To set up Testplane, you need to specify at least one browser:

<MinimalConfig />

As the number of tests in the project grows, you will likely need more advanced featuresâ€”sets, plugins, and more browsers. Below is an example of a more extended configuration:

<ConfigExample />

## Configuration Reference {#config_sections_description}

The only mandatory section in Testplane settings is the `browsers` section.

All [browser settings][browsers] (except `desiredCapabilities`) can be moved to the global level so that they apply to all browsers. For example, this is convenient for setting timeouts for all browsers at once.

                Mandatory section. It specifies the settings for all browsers in which the tests
                will be run.

        <tr>
            <td>[`sets`][sets]</td>
            <td>
                Section that allows you to bind a set of tests to specific browsers and run them all
                at once with a single command. This can be useful, for example, for separately
                running desktop and mobile tests.

        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>[`system`][system]</td>
            <td>
                Section for Testplane's system settings. Allows you to set the number of
                subprocesses in which tests will be run, enable debug mode for WebDriver, and much
                more.

            <td>
                Function in which you can prepare the browser before tests are run in it. For
                example, you can add new commands to the _browser_ object in this function.

                Function in which you can set environment variables or, for example, supplement some
                config parameters.

        <tr>
            <td>[`devServer`][dev-server]</td>
