# Testplane config

By default, Testplane searches for the file `.testplane.conf.ts` or `testplane.config.ts` at startup in the current working folder.

You can use configuration file stored at custom location by passing the `--config` CLI option.

## Setup {#setup}

To configure Testplane, you only need to specify at least one browser:

<MinimalConfig />

As your project grows, you will likely want to customize Testplane more, e.g. add sets, more browsers and plugins. Below is an example configuration with more options to explore:

<ConfigExample />

## Config Reference {#config_sections_description}

The only required section in Testplane config is the `browsers` section.

In order not to repeat common [settings of each browser][browsers] like timeouts over and over again, you can take them to the top level of the config.

<thead>
<tr><td>**Name**</td><td>**Description**</td></tr>

<tbody>
<tr><td>[browsers][browsers]</td><td>Required section. It sets the settings of all browsers in which the tests will be run.</td></tr>
<tr><td>[sets][sets]</td><td>A section that allows you to bind a set of tests to certain browsers and run them at once with one command. For example, you can launch desktop and mobiles tests separately by using this option.</td></tr>
<tr><td>[system][system]</td><td>Testplane system settings section. Allows you to set the number of subprocesses to run the tests in, enable the debug mode for WebDriver, and much more.</td></tr>
<tr><td>[plugins][plugins]</td><td>A section with which you can mount external plugins to Testplane.</td></tr>
<tr><td>[lastFailed][last-failed]</td><td>A section with which you can configure the rerun of failed tests.</td></tr>
<tr><td>[prepareBrowser][prepare-browser]</td><td>A function in which you can prepare the browser before to run the tests in it. For example, in this function you can add new commands for the _browser_ object.</td></tr>
<tr><td>[prepareEnvironment][prepare-environment]</td><td>A function in which you can set environment variables or, for example, add some config parameters.</td></tr>
