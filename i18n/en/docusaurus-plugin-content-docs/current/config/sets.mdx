# sets

## Overview {#overview}

You can use sets to bind a set of tests to specific browsers and run them all at once with the command `testplane --set <set-name>`.

This can be convenient for running tests by platforms: `desktop`, `touch-phone`, etc. You may also have a `common` set corresponding to common tests that you will always run in all browsers.

A set of tests is specified as an array of paths to them or to folders containing them on the file system. You can also specify paths to ignore when searching for tests to speed up the Testplane test reading process.

If there are no sets in the config, or you do not specify them when running Testplane (see the “[Usage](#usage)” section), then all tests from the `testplane` folder will be run in all browsers specified in the [browsers][browsers] section of the Testplane config.

## Setup {#setup}

The `sets` section has the following format:

<SetsBasicFormat />

Where `<set-id>` is the name of the set used for its identification.

### Sets Section Reference {#setup_description}

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <td>**Parameter**</td>
            <td>**Type**</td>
            <td>**Default**</td>
            <td>**Description**</td>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>`files`</td>
            <td>`string | string[]`</td>
            <td>_N/A_</td>
            <td>
                List of paths to files or folders with tests. In the case of a single path, the
                parameter can be specified as a string. You can also use
                [patterns][fast-glob-patterns].
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>`ignoreFiles`</td>
            <td>`string | string[]`</td>
            <td>`[ ]`</td>
            <td>
                List of paths or [patterns][fast-glob-patterns] to ignore when searching for test
                files. This parameter allows speeding up the Testplane test reading process.
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>`browsers`</td>
            <td>`string[]`</td>
            <td>_all browsers_</td>
            <td>
                List of browsers in which the tests will be run. You can specify only the browsers
                listed in the [browsers][browsers] section of the Testplane config. Default: all
                browsers from the [browsers][browsers] section.
            </td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

## Setup Example {#setup_example}

<SetsExample />

In this example, the **common** set contains all tests in the `common` directory and will run in all browsers. The **desktop** set contains all tests in the `common` and `desktop` directories but will only run in `chrome` and `firefox`.

## Usage {#usage}

Use the CLI option `--set` to specify a set when running tests.

Example of how to run tests for the desktop platform with the configuration provided [above](#setup_example):

```bash
testplane --set desktop
```

If there are no sets in the config, or they exist but the `--set` option was not specified, and no paths were passed to testplane via CLI, then all tests from the `testplane` folder will be run in all [browsers][browsers].
