# Overview

**Testplane** — a tool for automating testing of user scenarios in web interfaces.

With Testplane, you can test the functionality of your site or project and ensure that your layout consistently matches what's expected under any circumstances. At your disposal, you have the full range of [commands][commands] provided by [WebDriverIO v8][webdriverio-api] and [all the capabilities of the Chrome DevTools protocol][how-to-use-cdp]. Additionally, you have the familiar [Mocha][mocha] syntax.

Is your testing workload growing as your project evolves? — Testplane allows you to easily scale your test runs without losing usability. It not only runs tests in parallel, across different browsers and platforms, but also gathers all the test results into a single HTML report with flexible viewing, grouping, and filtering capabilities.

Lacking some functionality? — Not an issue! You can write your own plugin to address your needs with maximum efficiency. Or find an existing plugin and add it to your project.

And that’s not all.

### Easy Setup and Great Features {#easystart_great_features}

-   quickly create a project using [create-testplane][create-testplane];
-   all key parameters have [optimal defaults][defaults];
-   easy to write tests based on [Mocha][mocha];
-   a wide [range of commands][commands], powered by [WebdriverIO v8][webdriverio-api];
-   a robust [assertView][assert-view] command for taking and comparing screenshots;
-   flexible [parameters management][assert-view-opts] for individual tests when comparing screenshots;
-   specify areas to ignore when taking screenshots;
-   automatic stitching of large images that exceed the viewport.

### Fast Test Execution {#fast}

-   thanks to [parallelism within Testplane][testplane-workers];
-   scale using [testplane-chunks][testplane-chunks];
-   [reusing sessions][sessions-reuse];
-   session caching with browsers;
-   20,000 tests in 10 minutes.

### Flexible Test Running {#flexible}

-   in a specific browser;
-   [across platforms (sets)][testplane-sets] — on desktop and mobile browsers;
-   [by matching patterns][testplane-option-grep];
-   [from a specific file][how-to-run-test-in-file];
-   [a set number of times to check stability][how-to-check-test-stability];
-   [helpers only.in, only.notIn, skip.in, skip.notIn, also.in][how-to-skip-tests].

### Smart Error Handling {#smart}

-   [reject sessions that fail with specific error patterns][patterns-on-reject];
-   [retries with time and count limits][retry-limiter];
-   [retries for infrastructure errors][retry-progressive].

### Detailed Test Run Report {#user_friendly}

-   can display [results of tens of thousands of tests simultaneously][html-reporter];
-   stays responsive regardless of volume;
-   provides complete information about the test run: retries, meta-information, screenshots, logs, etc.;
-   screenshot diff viewing in [6 modes][html-reporter-diff], including _switch, swipe_, and _onion skin_;
-   history of commands executed during the test is available;
-   if a test fails, the error message and stack trace are saved;
-   [flexible viewing, grouping, and filtering options][html-reporter-gui].

### Interactive Test Running {#interactive}

-   run tests directly from the report in [GUI mode][html-reporter-gui];
-   all reporting features listed above are available;
-   [ability to integrate additional controls][html-reporter-plugins] for GUI mode from other plugins;
-   accelerated screenshot updating;

### Rich Debugging Capabilities {#debuggable}

-   [DevTools in CDP mode][how-to-use-cdp];
-   [Testplane profiling][testplane-profiler];
-   [plugin profiling][testplane-plugins-profiler].

### Extensibility {#extendable}

-   [easily add your own commands][prepare-browser];
-   dozens of [ready-made plugins][plugins];
-   write your own plugin to implement any functionality;
-   [over 20 events you can subscribe to][testplane-events];
-   available [extension points][html-reporter-extension-points] in the testplane report;
-   [extend the Testplane CLI from your plugin][testplane-cli], adding new commands and options.
