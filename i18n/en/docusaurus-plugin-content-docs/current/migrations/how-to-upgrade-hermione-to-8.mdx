# How to Upgrade hermione to Version 8.x

<Admonition type="warning">
If your project is using a hermione version earlier than 4.x, first read:
* "How to Upgrade hermione to Version 4.x";
* "How to Upgrade hermione to Version 5.x";
* "How to Upgrade hermione to Version 6.x";
* "How to Upgrade hermione to Version 7.x".

We recommend upgrading hermione in stages, ensuring each step that all project tests run correctly.

## What Has Changed? {#what_is_new}

### Major Changes {#major_changes}

#### Package Exports Changed {#package_exports_changed}

To use hermione via API in JavaScript, you now need to import `hermione` as follows:

```javascript
const { default: hermione } = require("hermione");
```

Previously, you could write it like this:

```javascript
const hermione = require("hermione");
```

For TypeScript:

```typescript
import hermione from "hermione";
```

#### moveTo Command Changed {#move_command_changed}

The `moveTo` command now moves the cursor relative to the center of the element rather than the top-left corner. If the element is not visible, it will scroll to it. Previously, calling the command without arguments (`await browser.$('body').moveTo()`) moved the cursor to the top-left corner of the element - now it will move to the center of the element.

If you don't have time to switch to the new logic of `moveTo`, you can use the `moveCursorTo` command, which works as it did in hermione@7. This command was added in hermione@8.1.0. The `moveCursorTo` command is temporary and will be removed in the next major version.

#### Dropped Support for Node.JS < 18.x {#dropped_nodejs_less_than_18x}

In this major version, hermione no longer supports versions _Node.JS < 18.x_.

### Minor Changes {#minor_changes}

-   Added REPL mode for step-by-step debugging of tests in all browsers (not only CDP) without restarting.
-   Added a browser command [clearSession][hermione-clear-session] to clear session state:
    -   Deletes cookies;
    -   Clears local storage;
    -   Clears session storage.
-   Added a browser command `openAndWait` with customizable wait options for page loads (by selector, custom predicate, network request, etc.).
-   Added a CLI option `--devtools` to simplify switching between the two protocols (`devtools` and `webdriver`).
-   Improved stack trace for `unhandled rejection` errors.
-   Now [isolation][hermione-isolation] is enabled by default for Chrome >= 94.
-   During the execution of the [assertView][hermione-assert-view] command, CSS animations on the page will be disabled by default.
-   Implemented generation of a unique `X-Request-ID` header for each request in the browser. The header consists of `${TEST_X_REQ_ID}${DELIMITER}$BROWSER_X_REQ_ID}`, where:

    -   `TEST_X_REQ_ID` - a unique UUID for each test run (including retries of the same test). This allows you to find all requests related to a single test run in the logs.
    -   `DELIMITER` - `__` separator between the test and request UUIDs.
    -   `BROWSER_X_REQ_ID` - a unique UUID for each browser request.

    A real example of a UUID is `2f31ffb7-369d-41f4-bbb8-77744615d2eb__e8d011d8-bb76-42b9-b80e-02f03b8d6fe1`.

### Patch Changes {#patch_changes}

-   Fixed disabling animations in iframes for iOS when using [assertView][hermione-assert-view].
-   Eliminated reinitialization of browser sessions in workers.
-   Fixed a bug where it was impossible to disable [isolation][hermione-isolation].
