# How to Upgrade hermione to Version 6.x

<Admonition type="warning">
If your project is using a hermione version earlier than 4.x, please first read "How to Upgrade hermione to Version 4.x" and "How to Upgrade hermione to Version 5.x".

We recommend upgrading hermione in stages, ensuring each step that all project tests run correctly.

## What Has Changed? {#what_is_new}

### Dropped Support for Node.JS < 14.x {#dropped_nodejs_less_than_14x}

In this major version, hermione no longer supports versions _Node.JS < 14.x_.

If your project is already using _Node.JS_ version _14.x_ or higher and this does not apply to you, we still recommend upgrading hermione to version 6 to get [the latest features][hermione-new-features].

### browserWSEndpoint {#added_browser_ws_endpoint_setting}

There is now a [browserWSEndpoint][browser-ws-endpoint] option in the browser settings, which allows you to override the link for accessing browsers via the [Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP)][how-to-use-cdp].

Example configuration:

```javascript
//.hermione.conf.js
const gridHost = "localhost";

module.exports = {
    gridUrl: `https://${gridHost}/:4444/wd/hub`,
    browserWSEndpoint: `ws:${gridHost}/wd/hub`,

    // other hermione settings...
};
```

<Admonition type="warning">
    This setting will not work if your project is using a very old browser version. It is guaranteed
    to work in Chrome, starting from version 101.
</Admonition>
