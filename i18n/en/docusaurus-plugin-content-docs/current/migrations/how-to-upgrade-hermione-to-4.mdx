# How to Upgrade hermione to Version 4.x

<Admonition type="warning">
    This guide is relevant only for projects using hermione versions older than 4.x.
</Admonition>

## Why Should You Upgrade? {#why_to_upgrade}

A long time ago, hermione switched to a "temporary" fork of the [webdriverio@4][webdriverio] package (abbr. wdio) that it used "under the hood" because issues in the _external_ _wdio_ were slowing down its development: constant bugs in _wdio_, disagreements over changes, etc. Initially, the fork was regularly updated by the hermione team to provide users with up-to-date functionality, but over time, the fork significantly lagged behind the current version of _wdio_ globally.

By the time many new features appeared in _wdio_ that interested developers, such as [Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP)][how-to-use-cdp], [mocking external requests][how-to-intercept-requests-and-responses], extended mobile device capabilities, etc., the hermione team had no choice but to abandon the _webdriverio@4_ fork and switch to the latest version of _webdriverio@7_.

<Admonition type="info">
    Version 8 of _webdriverio_ is already available, and _hermione@7_ uses it.
</Admonition>

Additionally, users found it increasingly inconvenient to use outdated commands: typings had to be included from a separate package (in the new _wdio_, they are included out of the box), and documentation for commands had to be accessed on the [old site][webdriverio-v4-api], while some users occasionally visited the [current page][webdriverio-api] and couldn't understand why the commands from the documentation didn't work in hermione.

Thus, there were plenty of reasons for a radical upgrade — jumping up by three major versions.

## What Has Changed? {#what_is_new}

There are many changes, so only the most important/interesting ones will be listed below.

### Command API {#api_changes}

#### async/await Instead of Chaining {#feature_async_await}

In the new version, you can no longer write tests using _chaining_. Only _async/await_ syntax is available:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="Old" label="Old">
```javascript
  it('some test', function() {
      return this.browser
          .foo()
          .bar()
          .baz();
  });
  ```
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="New" label="New">
```javascript
  it('some test', async function() {
      await this.browser.foo();
      await this.browser.bar();
      await this.browser.baz();
  });
  ```
</TabItem>

</Tabs>

Starting from version [hermione@4.9.0](https://github.com/gemini-testing/hermione/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#490-2022-05-24), you can write tests even shorter, as hermione now passes an object with a `browser` field to the function:

```javascript
it("some test", async function ({ browser }) {
    await browser.foo();
    await browser.bar();
    await browser.baz();
});
```

<Admonition type="warning">
    In the "New" examples going forward, it is assumed that the hermione version is at least
    _4.9.0_. If you plan to use hermione _4+_ but at a lower version than _4.9.0_, you should still
    access the browser in tests through _this_, for example: _await
    this.browser.getText('.selector')_.
</Admonition>

#### Direct Result Instead of Object with value Key {#feature_direct_result}

Now, instead of returning an object with a `value` key, the actual result is directly returned from command results (old behavior often led to errors in tests):

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="Old" label="Old">
```javascript
  it('some test', async function() {
      const { value } = await this.browser.getText('.selector');
      console.log(value); // some text
  });
  ```
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="New" label="New">
```javascript
  it('some test', async function({ browser }) {
      const text = await browser.getText('.selector');
      console.log(text); // some text
  });
  ```
</TabItem>

</Tabs>

#### Direct Work with Elements {#feature_commands_of_elements}

Using the [`browser.$`][browser-dollar] command, you can get an instance of the found element and work with it in the test. This is convenient when you need to interact with an element more than once (the element won't be searched again on the page):

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="Old" label="Old">
```javascript
  it('some test', async function() {
      await this.browser.clearElement('.input');
      await this.browser.setValue('.input', 'text');
  });
  ```
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="New" label="New">
```javascript
  it('some test', async function({ browser }) {
      const elem = await browser.$('.input');

      await elem.clearElement();
      await elem.setValue('text');

});

````
</TabItem>

</Tabs>

Also see the commands:

* [`browser.$$`][browser-dollar-dollar]
* [`element.$`][element-dollar]
* [`element.$$`][element-dollar-dollar]

#### Passing Arguments Through an Object {#feature_passing_args_as_object}

For many commands, arguments are now passed using an object with understandable keys instead of sequentially passing arguments, which could be very confusing. For example, in the [waitForExist][element-wait-for-exist] command, which previously accepted even boolean values as arguments:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="Old" label="Old">
```javascript
it('some test', async function() {
    await this.browser.waitForExist('.selector', 1000, true);
});
````

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="New" label="New">
```javascript
  it('some test', async function({ browser }) {
      const elem = await browser.$('.selector');

      await elem.waitForExist({
          timeout: 1000,
          interval: 500,
          reverse: true,
          timeoutMsg: 'still exists'
      });

});

````
</TabItem>

</Tabs>

#### Special Command for React {#feature_commands_for_react}

A bonus for those who are already using React — now you can use the [`browser.react$`][browser-react-dollar] and [`browser.react$$`][browser-react-dollar-dollar] commands to find specific react components on the page with certain states. Similar commands are available for elements as well — [`element.react$`][element-react-dollar] and [`element.react$$`][element-react-dollar-dollar].

Also read [the article on working with react components][react-selectors] on the _webdriverio_ website.

Example usage:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="Old" label="Old">
```javascript
it('some test', async function() {
    // no special commands for working with react components :(
});
````

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="New" label="New">
```javascript
  it('some test', async function({ browser }) {
      const component = await browser.react$('MyComponent', {
          props: { someProp: true },
          state: 'some-state'
      });

      const result = await component.isDisplayed();

});

````
</TabItem>

</Tabs>

### Up-to-Date Documentation {#feature_actual_docs}

While hermione used the old version of _webdriverio@4_, users constantly had to be reminded that the documentation for all commands was located at a separate address: [v4.webdriver.io/api.html][webdriverio-v4-api]. Now, descriptions of all _webdriverio_ commands used by hermione can be found at the standard address: [webdriver.io/docs/api][webdriverio-api].

In addition, we [translated the descriptions of all commands into Russian][hermione-commands] and adapted all usage examples to hermione, since _webdriverio_ uses its own runner and the examples in its documentation cannot be directly applied in hermione.

### Tests Run Faster {#feature_running_tests_faster}

You might not notice this speedup when running several tests locally, but it will be very noticeable with a large number of tests. The new commands work about 15% faster (assuming you have stopped using the old commands).

### Easy Local Browser Testing {#feature_running_tests_in_local_browser}

Previously, to run tests locally in your browser, you had to start `selenium-standalone` and specify a magical `gridUrl` to make things work in hermione. Now, it's much simpler: in the config, just specify the `automationProtocol` option with the value `devtools`:

```javascript
// hermione.conf.js
module.exports = {
  browsers: {
      chrome: {
          automationProtocol: 'devtools',
          desiredCapabilities: {
              // ...
          }
      }
  },

  // other hermione settings...
};
````

We also plan to add a separate button in the hermione GUI for switching to CDP mode to make it even easier.

<Admonition type="warning">
    * Currently, this is fully supported only in the _Chrome_ browser. * Retaking screenshots in
    this mode should only be done for debugging, as browsers in the pipeline run under _Linux_,
    which means page rendering will differ and tests in the pull request will fail with diffs.
</Admonition>

### API for Network Request Stubbing {#feature_api_to_mock_network}

The new version provides the ability to stub or override the responses of your service. This is done using the [mock.respond()][mock] command. You can also block URLs of external services.

Read more about all the features in the "How to Track and Intercept Network Requests and Responses" guide.

<Admonition type="warning">
    Currently, this functionality only works in _Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP)_ mode, which only
    works in _Chrome_ and _Firefox Nightly_.
</Admonition>

### Browser Configuration in the Config {#browsers_config}

For browsers that support the W3C protocol, instead of the `version` field, you need to specify `browserVersion`. And additional options need to be prefixed with the browser's name:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="Old" label="Old">
```javascript
  module.exports = {
      browsers: {
          'chrome-desktop': {
              desiredCapabilities: {
                  browserName: 'chrome',
                  version: '75',
                  'chromeOptions': {
                      // ...
                  }
              }
          }
      }
  };
  ```
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="New" label="New">
```javascript
  module.exports = {
      browsers: {
          'chrome-desktop': {
              desiredCapabilities: {
                  browserName: 'chrome',
                  browserVersion: '75',
                  'goog:chromeOptions': { // for Chrome browser, prefix with 'goog'
                      // ...
                  }
              }
          }
      }
  };
  ```
</TabItem>

</Tabs>

## How to Migrate? {#how_to_move}

We upgraded _webdriverio_ by three major versions at once, so simply updating the hermione version in `package.json` won't suffice. The main issues during migration are the absent _chaining_ in tests and outdated test commands. To help you with these issues, we wrote the following guide.

### 1. Update hermione to 4+, Install Migrator Plugin and Codemod {#update_hermione_and_install_plugin_and_codmode}

Specifically:

-   Update hermione to hermione@4.0.0.
-   Install the [hermione-wdio-migrator][hermione-wdio-migrator] plugin for smooth command migration.
-   Install the [hermione-codemod][hermione-codemod] package to convert existing tests to the new syntax.

You can do all this with one command:

```shell
npm install -D hermione@4.0.0 hermione-wdio-migrator hermione-codemod --save-exact
```

The versions of all hermione plugins (e.g., [html-reporter][html-reporter]) also need to be updated to the latest versions, as some may not work correctly with the new hermione version.

### 2. Run the Codemod for async/await {#change_to_async_await_by_codmode}

The codemod will regenerate your tests from _chaining_ format to _async/await_ format:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="zsh" label="zsh">
If you use the _zsh_ shell, you can pass test files as relative paths and as glob patterns, such as _somefolder/**/*.js_, and so on.

    ```shell
    npx jscodeshift -t node_modules/hermione-codemod/transforms/browser-chaining-to-async-await.js path_to_file_mask
    ```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="bash" label="bash">
If you use the _bash_ shell, globs won't work as easily as in _zsh_, so the command will be more complex if you need to process a group of files. For example:

    ```shell
    npx jscodeshift -t node_modules/hermione-codemod/transforms/browser-chaining-to-async-await.js $(find ./somefolder -type f -iname '*.js' | xargs echo)
    ```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

Upon successful completion, you will see a corresponding message:

```shell
Results:
0 errors
0 unmodified
0 skipped
251 ok
```

However, there can be cases the current codemod cannot handle. For such tests, an error with information about the problematic file will be displayed:

```shell
WARN: can't correctly transform ConditionalExpression, fix it manually
      file: tests/hermione/suites/common/promotion-page/promotion-page.hermione.js
      position: {"start":112,"end":116}
```

Such tests will need to be fixed manually. We tried to account for most test cases, so there shouldn't be too many of these instances.

After this, you can **already** merge your changes (this is optional) to perform the migration in parts. The _async/await_ syntax will still work in _wdio@4_. Many services have been writing tests this way for a long time.

### 3. Run the Codemod to Remove value {#remove_value_by_codmode}

Since command results now directly return the actual result instead of an object with a `value` key, you need to change result handling in all tests. This codemod is intended for such cases.

The command is very similar to the previous one, only the path to the next codemod file changes:

```shell
npx jscodeshift -t node_modules/hermione-codemod/transforms/remove-browser-prop.js path_to_file_mask
```

For any warnings, problematic tests need to be fixed manually. For example, if a test uses `value` multiple times through destructuring, the codemod will not handle it properly and generic variable names might be generated. For example:

```javascript
// test on wdio@4:
it('test', function(){
    return this.browser
        ...
        .getText('.button')
        .then((value) => {
            assert.equal(value, 'Button', 'We need a button');
        })
        ...
        .getValue('.input')
        .then((value) => {
            assert.equal(value, 'Hello', 'We were not greeted');
        });
});

// auto-generated for wdio@7 in this format:
it('test', async function() {
    const value = await this.browser.getText('.button');
    assert.equal(value, 'Button', 'We need a button');
    ...
    // there will be an error due to reuse of the variable name,
    // so the codemod will issue a warning about the problematic spot
    const value = await this.browser.getValue('.input');
    assert.equal(value, 'Hello', 'We were not greeted');
});
```

If your project has too many tests that cannot be automatically migrated, please reach out to [github issues][gh-issues] for help. We will analyze these errors and assist with the migration.

### 4. Add hermione-wdio-migrator to the hermione Config {#add_migrator}

This plugin "under the hood" simply adds the implementation of old commands using the new API, so during migration, you don't have to update tests yourself. Eventually, you should replace these deprecated commands with new ones in your tests:

```javascript
module.exports = {
    plugins: {
        "hermione-wdio-migrator": {
            enabled: true,
        },

        // other hermione plugins...
    },

    // other hermione settings...
};
```

### 5. Remove the Codemod {#remove_codemod}

Uninstall the [hermione-codemod][hermione-codemod] package as you won't need it anymore.

```shell
npm uninstall hermione-codemod
```

### 6. Run Linters {#run_linters}

Run linters on the modified tests, as the codemod might have violated your project's coding standards.

### 7. Run the Tests {#run_tests}

Finally, ensure that all tests pass successfully by creating a pull request and verifying that all tests run successfully in CI.

## Conclusion {#conclusion}

Updating _webdriverio_ brings many useful features that can be used right away, while some will appear in a more convenient form later. Therefore, we highly recommend upgrading to the new version to make writing tests more convenient, faster, and enjoyable.

<Admonition type="warning">
    The old hermione version is in limited support mode, and new features will not appear in it.
