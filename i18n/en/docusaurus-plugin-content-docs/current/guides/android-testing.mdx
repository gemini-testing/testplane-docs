## Overview

Testplane uses WebdriverIO to communicate with browsers and devices, so out of the box, it supports testing native Android applications on real devices or emulators using [Appium](https://appium.io/docs/en/latest/).

## Quick Start

-   [Template Project](https://github.com/webdriverio/appium-boilerplate) for running tests on Android/iOS using WebdriverIO and Appium
-   [Documentation](https://webdriver.io/docs/api/appium) for interacting with Appium using WebdriverIO
-   [Appium Documentation](https://appium.io/docs/en/2.0/intro/)
