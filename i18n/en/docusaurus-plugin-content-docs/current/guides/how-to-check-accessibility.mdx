# How to Test Page Accessibility

[Accessibility tree][accessibility-tree] is an accessibility tree that contains a hierarchical structure of accessible objects. Unlike the DOM tree, which is intended for browsers, the accessibility tree is intended for [screen readers][screen-reader] and other tools that help people with disabilities interact with websites.

To obtain such a tree, _puppeteer_ has a special [Accessibility class][puppeteer-accessibility].

## Example {#example}

Here's an example of how to use it:

```javascript
it("should get accessibility tree of yandex.ru", async function () {
    // Get puppeteer instance
    const puppeteer = await this.browser.getPuppeteer();

    // Get the first open page (considering it to be currently active)
    const [page] = await puppeteer.pages();

    await this.browser.url("https://yandex.ru");

    // Get the current state of the accessibility tree
    const snapshot = await page.accessibility.snapshot();
    console.log("snapshot:", JSON.stringify(snapshot, null, 4));
});
```

## Accessibility Tree {#accessibility_tree}

And here's how the obtained accessibility tree looks:

```json
{
    "role": "WebArea",
    "name": "Yandex",
    "children": [
        {
            "role": "link",
            "name": "Login"
        },
        {
            "role": "link",
            "name": "Mail"
        },
        {
            "role": "link",
            "name": "Disk"
        },
        {
            "role": "link",
            "name": "Try Plus"
        },

        // omitted for brevity...

        {
            "role": "link",
            "name": "finance"
        },
        {
            "role": "link",
            "name": "politics"
        }
    ]
}
```

Using the obtained tree, we can check that all necessary nodes are contained in the tree and have the correct structure.
