# How to Connect testing-library in testplane

## Introduction {#preface}

[Testing-library][testing-library] is a collection of tools for testing web application user interfaces, focused on creating reliable and maintainable tests by emphasizing user behavior. The main advantage of `testing-library` is its focus on interaction with interface elements. And in testplane, you can use the element search methods provided by the `testing-library` itself.

## Connection

To be able to use [queries][queries] from `testing-library` in Testplane tests, you only need to follow a few steps.

1. Install the npm package `'@testing-library/webdriverio'`

```bash
npm i -D @testing-library/webdriverio
```

2. Include it in the Testplane config in the `prepareBrowser` section:

```javascript
// .testplane.conf.js
const { setupBrowser } = require("@testing-library/webdriverio");

module.exports = {
    prepareBrowser(browser) {
        setupBrowser(browser);
    },

    // other Testplane settings...
};
```

## Usage

After configuring, you will be able to use the search by selectors from `testing-library`, as described in the [official documentation](https://testing-library.com/docs/queries/about/). For example, searching for an element by its text:

```javascript
it("example", async ({ browser }) => {
    await browser.url("https://github.com/");

    const newRepoButton = await browser.getByText("New");

    await newRepoButton.click();
});
```

This feature will also be available in the context of found elements:

```javascript
it("example", async ({ browser }) => {
    await browser.url("https://github.com/");

    const sidebar = await browser.$(".dashboard-sidebar");
    const newRepoButton = await sidebar.getByText("New");

    await newRepoButton.click();
});
```
