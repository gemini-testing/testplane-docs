# How to Hide Scrollbars Using Chrome DevTools Protocol

## Overview {#overview}

<Admonition type="warning">
This recipe only works when using _Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP)_.

One of the reasons for test failures when testing layouts using screenshots is the presence of scrollbars in the browser at the moment the screenshot is taken. You can read more about this problem and some ways to solve it [here](../how-to-hide-scrollbars). This problem arises particularly often in tests with mobile emulation.

CDP has a special method [Emulation.setScrollbarsHidden][set-scrollbars-hidden] that allows hiding the scrollbar. However, _puppeteer_ lacks a wrapper for this method. Therefore, we will use the [CDPSession.send][cdp-session-send] method to execute the [Emulation.setScrollbarsHidden][set-scrollbars-hidden] command.

## Example: How to Hide Scrollbars Using CDP {#example}

Here's how it looks:

```javascript
it("should hide scrollbar", async function () {
    // Get puppeteer instance
    const puppeteer = await this.browser.getPuppeteer();

    // Get the first open page (considering it to be currently active)
    const [page] = await puppeteer.pages();

    // Create a CDP session
    const client = await page.target().createCDPSession();

    // Hide the scrollbar
    await client.send("Emulation.setScrollbarsHidden", { hidden: true });

    await this.browser.url("https://yandex.ru");
});
```

There you will also learn about the [hermione-hide-scrollbars](../../plugins/hermione-hide-scrollbars) plugin, which is implemented based on the [Emulation.setScrollbarsHidden][set-scrollbars-hidden] method and which you can use to disable scrollbars in CI for all tests in specific browsers.
