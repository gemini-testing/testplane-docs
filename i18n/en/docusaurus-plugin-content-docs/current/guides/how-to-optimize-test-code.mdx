# How to Eliminate Duplication in Tests

## Problem {#problem}

Often, before running the next testplane test, certain preparatory work needs to be done, such as:

-   clearing all cookies;
-   cleaning localStorage;
-   initializing some test variable.

Similarly, after completing the main checks in a testplane test, you may always want to check for errors in the client code, the triggering of required metrics, etc.

## Solution: testplane-global-hook {#solution}

To avoid repeating these actions each time in your tests, add the [testplane-global-hook][testplane-global-hook] plugin and describe them in the plugin settings as functions for the `beforeEach` and `afterEach` hooks.

Learn more about how to add and configure the plugin in the [plugin documentation][testplane-global-hook].
