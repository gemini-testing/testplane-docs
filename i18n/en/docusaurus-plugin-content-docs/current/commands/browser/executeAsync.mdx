# executeAsync

## Overview {#overview}

Use the `executeAsync` command to _asynchronously_ execute the specified JavaScript code in the context of the currently selected frame.

The last argument of the command must be a callback that will be called as soon as the script completes its execution. The command passes the script result to the callback as an input parameter.

The `script` argument defines the script to be executed as the body of a function. The function will be invoked with the provided array of `args`, and access to the values can be obtained through the `arguments` object in the specified order. The last argument must always be a callback function, which will be called once the script has been executed.

Arguments can be any JSON primitives, arrays, or JSON objects. JSON objects that define a reference to a _WebElement_ will be converted to the corresponding DOM element. Similarly, any _WebElements_ in the script result will be returned to the client as _WebElement JSON_ objects.

## Usage {#usage}

```javascript
await browser.executeAsync(script, arguments);
```
