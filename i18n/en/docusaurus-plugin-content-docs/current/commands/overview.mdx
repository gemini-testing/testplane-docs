# Testplane Commands

## Overview

<Admonition type="warning">
    Only commands for the latest version Testplane v8 and WebDriverIO v8 are described. Commands for older versions should be referenced in the WebDriverIO documentation (example for [WebDriverIO v7][webdriverio@7-api]).
</Admonition>

Since testplane is based on [WebDriverIO v8][webdriverio-api], all commands provided by WebDriverIO are available in it.

However, the command descriptions on the [WebDriverIO][webdriverio-api] website for version 8 are not quite suitable _as is_ for testplane users due to a number of reasons:

-   In WebDriverIO, the `browser` object exists in the global scope, whereas in testplane you need to either write `this.browser`:

```javascript
it("should test something", async function() {
    const browser = this.browser;
    // test code...
});
```

or get the `browser` object from the function argument (note that the `browser` object is passed inside an object!):

```javascript
it("should test something", async ({ browser }) => {
    // test code...
});
```

-   Similarly, the `browser.$` and `browser.$$` functions in WebDriverIO are available in tests under the names `$` and `$$`, while in testplane you need to refer to them by their full path: `browser.$` and `browser.$$`;

-   There are no links established between similar commands: no clustering of commands;

-   All commands are described only in English.

Nevertheless, our description does not yet include protocol-specific commands. You can find the relevant commands on the WebDriverIO website under the "[Protocols][webdriverio-protocols]" section.

Also, in the descriptions of some commands, links to individual recipes are still not localized and lead to the WebDriverIO website.
