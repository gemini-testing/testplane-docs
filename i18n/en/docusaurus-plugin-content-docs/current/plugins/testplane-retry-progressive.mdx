# testplane-retry-progressive

## Overview {#overview}

Use the `testplane-retry-progressive` plugin to additionally retry tests if the errors with which they fail correspond to a given set of patterns.

What might it be needed for?

Tests can fail not only because of developer errors, races between scripts executed on a web page, but also for infrastructural reasons. For example, when the network blinks, the browser is not given in time, temporary problems with DNS, etc.

<details>
    <summary>See examples of patterns for such errors</summary>* Browser request was cancelled * A
    window size operation failed because the window is not currently available * chrome not
    reachable * Tried to run command without establishing a connection * No such driver * no such
    window * Session timed out or not found * Reached error page * getaddrinfo ENOTFOUND * Browsing
    context has been discarded * Cannot launch browser * Failed to decode response from marionette *
    session deleted because of page crash * Couldn't connect to selenium server
</details>

## Install {#install}

```bash
npm install -D testplane-retry-progressive
```

## Setup {#setup}

Add the plugin to the `plugins` section of the `testplane` config:

```javascript
module.exports = {
    plugins: {
        "testplane-retry-progressive": {
            enabled: true,
            extraRetry: 7,
            errorPatterns: [
                "Parameter .* must be a string",
                {
                    name: "Cannot read property of undefined",
                    pattern: "Cannot read property .* of undefined",
                },
            ],
        },

        // other testplane plugins...
    },

    // other testplane settings...
};
```

### Description of configuration parameters {#setup_description}

<table>
<thead>
<tr><td>**Parameter**</td><td>**Type**</td><td>**Default value**</td><td>**Description**</td></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td>enabled</td><td>Boolean</td><td>true</td><td>Enable / disable the plugin.</td></tr>
<tr><td>extraRetry</td><td>Number</td><td>5</td><td>The number of times you need to retry the test if it crashes with an error that matches one of the _errorPatterns_.</td></tr>
<tr><td>errorPatterns</td><td>Array</td><td>`[ ]`</td><td>A list of patterns, one of which an error should match in order for the plugin to retry the test. For more information, see below.</td></tr>

</tbody>
</table>

### errorPatterns {#setup_error_patterns}

Each pattern in the `errorPatterns` array is either an object of the form:

```javascript
{
    name: 'A clear message for the user that will be output to the console',
    pattern: 'An error pattern that can be set, among other things, as a string for a regular expression'
}
```

or a string that will be interpreted by the plugin as an object of the form:

```javascript
{
    name: 'your string',
    pattern: 'your string'
}
```

The latter option is convenient if the readable format for the console and the error pattern completely match.

### Passing parameters via the CLI {#setup_by_cli}

All plugin parameters that can be defined in the config can also be passed as command-line options or through environment variables during the launch of Testplane. Use the prefix `--retry-progressive-` for command line options and `testplane_retry_progressive_` for environment variables. For example:

```bash
npx testplane --retry-progressive-extra-retry 3
```

```bash
testplane_retry_progressive_extra_retry=3 npx testplane
```
