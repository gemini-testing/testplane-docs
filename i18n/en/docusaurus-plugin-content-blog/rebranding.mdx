We present to your attention... **Testplane**. Our project Hermione has decided to change its name — meet the time-tested product in a fresh look!

<!-- truncate -->

We carefully considered all the pros and cons and concluded that the new name — Testplane — best reflects our vision and future development of the product:

1. We plan to actively invest in the development of the tool in open source. The new name symbolizes a qualitative leap in the development of the tool.
2. We aim to create a full-fledged brand with a trademark, logo, and corporate visual style. Testplane is a name that both references a "test flight" and can be read as "a plane for testing."

The essence of the product remains unchanged. Testplane is the same project you have known for many years as Hermione, but in a fresh, updated form. To simplify the transition, we decided to maintain continuous version numbering: Testplane v8.x is equivalent to Hermione v8.x.

If you are already working with Hermione, updating to Testplane will take just a few minutes. We designed it as a drop-in replacement:

-   Full support for existing Hermione plugins.
-   Understanding of all Hermione options and environment variables.
-   Full configuration compatibility.
-   Two binary files (testplane and hermione) for a smooth transition (you can run both as hermione gui and as testplane gui).
-   Type export for TypeScript, including both Testplane's own types and Hermione's types (including hermioneCtx).
