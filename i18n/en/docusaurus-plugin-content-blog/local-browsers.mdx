Testplane is now able to automatically download browsers for running tests locally. Enjoy a hassle-free start with `--local` option if you don't need remote browser grid.

<!-- truncate -->

Previously, Testplane with the webdriver automation protocol could only be launched locally with a manually started [selenium-standalone](https://github.com/webdriverio/selenium-standalone). Now, it is enough to specify `gridUrl: "local"` in the [Testplane Config](/docs/v8/config/main) or run tests with the [CLI option](/docs/v8/command-line) `--local`. In this case, if necessary, the corresponding browsers and web drivers will be downloaded before running the tests, and they will also be launched for further use in these tests.

You can also download the browsers and their web drivers separately using the [install-deps](/docs/v8/command-line#install-deps) command.

Example of running tests on local browser with webdriver automation protocol:

<video src={localBrowsersExampleUrl} width="100%" controls="controls" autoplay="autoplay">
    Tag video is not supported by your browser.
    <a href="video/blog/local-browsers/local-browsers-example.mp4">Download video</a>.
</video>
