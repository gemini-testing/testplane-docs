We have implemented an extension for [VS Code][vscode] for Testplane, which allows you to configure Testplane from scratch, run tests, and conveniently work with the <a href="/ru/docs/v8/command-line/#testplane-repl">REPL mode</a>.

<!-- truncate -->

### Installation

Install the extension from the [VS Code Marketplace][vscode-testplane-marketplace] or from the extensions tab in the VS Code IDE.

![Extension in VS Code IDE](/img/blog/vscode-extension/testplane-in-extensions-panel.png)

After installation, open VS Code in an empty project and enter in the command panel:

```
Install Testplane
```

### Running tests

#### From the sidebar in the testing panel

The testing panel can be opened by clicking on the testing icon in the activity bar.

![Opening testing panel in activity bar](/img/blog/vscode-extension/testing-sidebar.png)

On the left side of the screen, a sidebar displays a tree of all read tests. The tree displays from top to bottom:

-   the name of the directory with tests (`testplane-tests`);
-   the name of the test file (`example.testplane.ts`);
-   the name of the suite (`test`). In the example, `describe` from the [Mocha BDD interface][mocha-bdd-interface] is used;
-   the name of the test (`example`). In the example, `it` from the [Mocha BDD interface][mocha-bdd-interface] is used;
-   the name of the browser in which the test will be run (`chrome`).

Each element in the tree has a `Run Test` button. If you click on it at the element:

-   for a directory, file, or suite, all child tests will run in all browsers;
-   for a test, the selected test will run in all browsers;
-   for a browser, one test will run in one browser.

Example of running tests from the sidebar:

<video src={runTestsFromSidebarVideoUrl} width="100%" controls="controls">
    The video tag is not supported by your browser.
    <a href="video/blog/vscode-extension/run-tests-from-sidebar.mp4">Download the video</a>.
</video>

You can also run all tests using the `Run Tests` button.

#### From a text editor

If you open a Testplane test in the text editor, a green play button will be displayed next to each suite (`describe`) and test (`it`) for launching them. If you click the left mouse button, the test will run in all browsers, and after execution, the result will be displayed as a status icon for the test's pass/fail status.
If you right-click the play button, you can run the test in one of the browsers.

Example of running tests from a text editor:

<video src={runTestsFromEditorVideoUrl} width="100%" controls="controls">
    The video tag is not supported by your browser.
    <a href="video/blog/vscode-extension/run-tests-from-editor.mp4">Download the video</a>.
</video>

#### With the `devtools` settings

In the sidebar of the testing panel, there is also a section titled Testplane. Here you can manage settings at runtime. By clicking the `Enable devtools` checkbox and subsequently running tests, browsers will launch using the CDP protocol (regardless of what is specified in the config). You can read more about this mode <a href="/en/docs/v8/guides/how-to-use-cdp/">here</a>..

#### With the `REPL` settings

When you click the checkbox `Enable REPL` and subsequently run a test (only one test can be run simultaneously in REPL mode), it will be launched in a special REPL mode. You can read more about this mode <a href="/ru/docs/v8/command-line/#testplane-repl">here</a>.

### Filtering tests in the sidebar of the testing panel

To display only tests in a specific browser in the tree, you need to enter the tag `@testplane:browser:your_browser_name` in the filtering input. To get a suggestion, you can simply type `@browser`. You can also use multiple tags there.

![Filter by specified browser](/img/blog/vscode-extension/filter_sidebar_by_browser.png)

You can also use the following values in the filter input:

-   a string with the name of the tree element (directory/file/suite/test/browser);
-   tag @doc - to display tests from the active file in the text editor;
-   tag @openedFiles - to display tests in all open files in the text editor;
-   tag @executed - to display only running tests;
-   tag @failed - to display only failed tests.

### Restarting the Testplane Environment

You can restart Testplane using the `Refresh Tests` button in the sidebar. In this case, the config and tests will be re-read. This will be useful if you have added a new test to a file (watching test files is not yet supported) or if a critical error has occurred. The test tree is automatically updated when the config changes.

### Requirements

-   the Testplane version must be 8.20.0 or higher (tests will not run with lower versions).

### Current Limitations

-   debug and continuous (auto-run) modes are not supported;
-   there is no watching for adding/removing tests and files;
-   using custom Mocha interfaces may lead to incorrect display of icons with the play button for running tests from the text editor.

### Conclusion

This functionality provides our users with new opportunities:

-   the ability to run tests directly from the IDE and view the execution results;
-   the ability to quickly switch to devtools and REPL mode;
-   automatically pick up changes made to the Testplane config.
