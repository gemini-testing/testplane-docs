Testplane now supports test run selectivity — the ability to automatically run only those tests whose dependency files have changed.

<!-- truncate -->

Selectivity allows you to significantly speed up the testing process by running only relevant tests instead of the entire suite. Testplane tracks each test’s dependencies on project files — both the test code itself and the code executed in the browser — and, when a file changes, runs only those tests that depend on it.

### How to use

Learn more in our guide [How to configure selectivity when running tests](/docs/v8/guides/selectivity).

### Conclusion

Upgrade to Testplane version 8.36.0 or higher and try selectivity in your projects! If you encounter any issues, feel free to open an [issue on GitHub](https://github.com/gemini-testing/testplane/issues) — we’ll be happy to help!
