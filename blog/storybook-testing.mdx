Now, for automatic visual testing of your components, you only need Storybook with your components and the `@testplane/storybook` plugin. Thereâ€™s no need to write any tests anymore.

<!-- truncate -->

[Storybook][storybook] is a tool for developing user interfaces based on components. It allows developers to independently visualize components in various states in an isolated environment, separate from other components.
This "showroom" is perfect for screenshot testing your components, as this isolated environment makes such tests significantly more stable and faster compared to e2e testing.

With the [@testplane/storybook][testplane-storybook] plugin, you can automatically verify changes to your components using screenshot testing without writing a single line of test code.
You just need to describe your component in `Storybook` and Testplane will automatically generate all necessary tests upon execution, run them in the required browsers and provide a visual report for updating screenshots.
Additionally, if a [play function][play-function] has been declared for the components, Testplane will execute it before the test begins to set the component to the desired state.

However, if these capabilities are not enough, you can directly describe a Testplane test in the story file, which will be executed as an additional test for the component.
